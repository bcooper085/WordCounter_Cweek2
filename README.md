# _Word Counter_

#### _C# application that returns how frequently a word appears in a given sentence_, 2/17/2017

#### By: _Brandon Cooper_

## Specifications
* App will store user input string in an array.<br>
_Input: "a"_<br>
_Output: [0] = "a"_<br>
Reason: A single word would be the easiest value to compare.

* App will allow user to input a word in a second field and store value in an array.<br>
_Input: "a"_<br>
_Output: [0] = "a"_<br>
Reason: A single word would be the easiest value to compare.

* App will compare word to sentence and determine if word is used in sentence.<br>
_Input: ([0] == [0])_<br>
_output: True_<br>
Reason: Storing both values in an array will be the simplest way to compare value.

* App will display counter of how many times word is used if previous output is true.<br>
_Input: True_<br>
_Output: int counter = 1_<br>
Reason: If true we can simply increment an int variable.
